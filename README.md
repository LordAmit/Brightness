# Brightness Controller

This is version 2 of Brightness Controller (beta). It is completely stable and we are working on some more features to be integrated before release.

## Installation
First, install pyside.

Somtimes it is not enough to install and integrate pyside, so you might also try installing pyside using pip.

```bash
pip install pyside
```

Next, download the latest zip file from [here](https://github.com/lordamit/Brightness/archive/develop.zip).

Extract it and open a terminal. Change directory to the `Brightness` folder. Next type this command:

```bash
python src/init.py
```

## Features

The following features are implemented:
1. Brightness Control
2. Reversing Brightness control for primary and secondary monitor in case you want to flip the controls.
1. Saving color profile
