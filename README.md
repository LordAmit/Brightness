# Brightness Controller

## What is it?

Brightness Controller allows you to control Brightness of your **Primary and Secondary Display** with the help of `xrandr` in Linux. It is a software based dimmer. The controller is created using Python, which in the back end calls `os.system` commands to execute system commands.

## What good is it?

It allows you to control the brightness of your monitor to a better extent. For example, my laptop's monitor brightness can be controlled using hardware keys at discrete values, such as 20%, 40%, 60%, ... 100%. Brightness Controller allows you to change the brightness to a better degree of control, ranging from 1% to 100%! It should be mentioned that it changes the present brightness value set via hardware control of your monitor. For example, if you set your Monitor's brightness to 50% using hardware buttons, then that will be the 100% value in Brightness controller. 

## How do I run it? 

- Download the [Latest version](https://github.com/lordamit/Brightness/archive/master.zip) to your home folder.
- Extract it.
- Open the `src/brightness.desktop` with your favourite text editor.
- Replace `path/to...` with the original path of `brightness.py` in line 4 and `brightness.svg` in line 7.
- Now `brightness.desktop` looks like 'Brightness Controller' and should have an icon.
- Double-click Brightness Controller and the app should run.

## What are the requirements / dependencies / things I need to run it?

I have found only three requirements till now.

1. Python - Linux should have it by default

2. Python WxWidgets
```bash
$ sudo apt-get install python-wxgtk2.8
```
3. `xrandr` - that's what the program uses in the backend to control the brightness of your monitor!

## It doesn't detect my displays properly

Kindly make an issue in the GitHub project and submit the output of this command:
```bash
$ xrandr -q
```

## I have more than two displays, and this program only shows two. What's happening?

In a word, *jealousy*. Because I never had more than two displays simultaneously, I decided to give support for up to two displays only. So no, it can not support your third (or fourth, or fifth...) display.

# Misc

Random questions that might show up here are answered here in advance.

## The coding style is not exactly... Python-like
 
Because it is my first Python code that exceeds 10 lines. I have not used Python before, but I decided to use it for this project for no particular reason.

## Why is it here?

I wrote it because I could not find any other similar software available **in Linux** that provides an easy to use UI for changing brightness. There are still room for improvement, specially in the coding style. I hope due to its open source nature, people will come forward and will help it become a better brightness controller.

## Help! It broke my computer!

*Erm, that's not exactly supposed to happen. Still, use at your own risk. I won't allow myself to be held responsible even if it turns your display into a black hole, sucks you in and kills you in the process.  
But still, let me know if something goes wrong by reporting it in the issues section.*

On a more serious note, Brightness Controller does nothing that can break your computer. It simply provides a graphical user interface you can use with a mouse to control brightness easily. It does not execute any command or does not do anything to change your system. So, feel free to use it. :)
